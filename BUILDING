This project uses Habitat for build management. In order to build it, ensure that Habitat is installed (https://www.habitat.sh) then run the following commands:

hab pkg build .
sudo hab pkg install ./results/saffronsnail-capstone-<VERSION>-<TIMESTAMP>-<ARCHITECTURE>-<OS>.hart

Note that you will need to replace the words in angle brackets with the appropriate information.

After running these commands there should exist a folder /hab/pkgs/saffronsnail/capstone/<VERSION>/<TIMESTAMP>. This is the root directory of the results of the build.
